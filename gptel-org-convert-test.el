This allows you to specify dependencies for each project separately, avoiding conflicts between different projects that may require different versions of the same library.

Key features of /Qlot/ include:

1. *Dependency Management*: Manage and install dependencies locally per project.
2. *Environment Isolation*: Each project can have its own set of libraries, independent of other projects.
3. *Integration with Quicklisp*: While Qlot creates isolated environments, it still uses Quicklisp to handle the actual library retrieval and installation.

This makes Qlot useful for maintaining a clean workspace, especially when working with multiple Common Lisp projects."))
