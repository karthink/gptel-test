Mars also has other notable mountains like Ascraeus Mons (about 21,229 meters / 69,625 feet) and Arsia Mons (approximately 20,003 meters / 65,000 feet). 

In summary, these Martian mountains significantly exceed the height of the tallest mountains on Earth.")) (:role "user" :parts [(:text "Why are they so much higher?")]) (:role "model" :parts (:text "The towering heights of Martian mountains can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Lower Gravity:** Mars has about 38% of Earth's gravity, allowing structures to grow taller without collapsing under their own weight.

2. **Lack of Plate Tectonics:** Mars lacks active plate tectonics, which means mountains can continue to build up over time without being eroded or broken down.

3. **Volcanic Activity:** Olympus Mons and other Martian mountains are shield volcanoes, which means they can accumulate vast layers of lava over time, contributing to their height.

4. **Atmospheric Conditions:** Mars has a thinner atmosphere than Earth, which leads to less erosion from wind and weather, allowing mountains to maintain their size over geological time.

These factors combine to enable Martian mountains to reach heights far exceeding those found on Earth.")))
