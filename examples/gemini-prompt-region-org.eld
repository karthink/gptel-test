((:role "model" :parts (:text "Jensen's inequality reflects how convex functions curve upwards. For a convex function, averaging inputs (i.e., \\( E[X] \\)) produces a lower output than averaging the outputs of each input (i.e., \\( E[f(X)] \\)). Think of a bowl shape: if you pick points inside the bowl (inputs), the point directly above the average (output of the average input) sits higher than the average of the bowl's surface points. This captures risk and uncertainty intuitively—taking averages of outcomes produces a more optimistic perspective under convexity.")) (:role "user" :parts [(:text "* Effect of distribution

Why is this result not affected by the distribution of \\( X \\)?")]) (:role "model" :parts (:text "Jensen's inequality is fundamentally linked to the properties of convex functions, not the specific distribution of \\( X \\). Regardless of how \\( X \\) is distributed (e.g., uniform, normal), the curvature of the convex function ensures that the relationship holds true. The expected value captures the central tendency, while convexity mandates that the function’s output will always favor higher values when averaging inputs rather than their outputs, independent of distribution characteristics. Thus, Jensen's inequality applies uniformly across all distributions.")) (:role "user" :parts [(:text "* Other inequalities
