((:role "user" :content "Why is this result not affected by the distribution of \\( X \\)?")
 (:role "assistant" :content "Jensen's inequality is fundamentally linked to the properties of convex functions, not the specific distribution of \\( X \\). Regardless of how \\( X \\) is distributed (e.g., uniform, normal), the curvature of the convex function ensures that the relationship holds true. The expected value captures the central tendency, while convexity mandates that the functionâ€™s output will always favor higher values when averaging inputs rather than their outputs, independent of distribution characteristics. Thus, Jensen's inequality applies uniformly across all distributions.")
