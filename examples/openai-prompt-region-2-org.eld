 (:role "assistant" :content "Chebyshev's inequality states that for any random variable \\( X \\) with mean \\( \\mu \\) and standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\), the probability that \\( X \\) deviates from its mean by more than \\( k \\) standard deviations is bounded:\n\n\\[\nP(|X - \\mu| \\geq k\\sigma) \\leq \\frac{1}{k^2}\n\\]\n\nfor \\( k > 0 \\). This result is non-parametric and applies to any distribution. It highlights the concentration of measure, asserting that most values lie within a few standard deviations of the mean, providing a way to quantify variability without relying on specific distribution forms."))
