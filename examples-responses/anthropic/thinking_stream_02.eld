 "The user wants to programmatically scan and remove all references to the hyperref package from LaTeX preamble. This includes package declarations, the hypersetup command, and any macros provided by hyperref like \\urlstyle.\n\nFor this task, we need a reliable approach that can:\n1. Identify the preamble (everything before \\begin{document})\n2. Remove \\usepackage{hyperref} and similar declarations\n3. Remove \\hypersetup{...} blocks (which may span multiple lines)\n4. Remove other hyperref-specific commands\n\nSome approaches to consider:\n- Using regular expressions\n- Using a LaTeX parser\n- Using a combination of pattern matching and context awareness\n\nThe challenge is that some commands might span multiple lines and there might be nested braces. Regular expressions alone might not be sufficient for complex cases, but they can handle most situations.\n\nLet me think about a comprehensive approach."
 "For reliable removal of hyperref-related content from a LaTeX preamble, I recommend using a combination of regex and LaTeX-aware parsing:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef remove_hyperref(preamble):\n    # 1. Remove \\usepackage{hyperref} and variants like \\usepackage[options]{hyperref}\n    preamble = re.sub(r'\\\\usepackage(\\s*\\[[^\\]]*\\])?\\s*\\{hyperref\\}', '', preamble)\n    \n    # 2. Remove \\hypersetup blocks (handling multi-line)\n    preamble = re.sub(r'\\\\hypersetup\\s*\\{[^{}]*(?:\\{[^{}]*\\}[^{}]*)*\\}', '', preamble)\n    \n    # 3. Remove known hyperref commands\n    hyperref_commands = [\n        r'\\\\urlstyle\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}',\n        r'\\\\href\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}',\n        r'\\\\url\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}',\n        r'\\\\hyperbaseurl\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}',\n        r'\\\\hyperref\\s*\\[[^]]*\\]',\n        r'\\\\hyperlink\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}',\n        r'\\\\hypertarget\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}\\s*\\{[^{}]*\\}'\n    ]\n    \n    for cmd in hyperref_commands:\n        preamble = re.sub(cmd, '', preamble)\n    \n    # 4. Clean up empty lines and multiple spaces\n    preamble = re.sub(r'\\n\\s*\\n+', '\\n\\n', preamble)\n    \n    return preamble\n```\n\nFor more complex LaTeX structures, consider using a dedicated LaTeX parser like `plasTeX` or `pylatexenc`. The regex approach works for most cases but might struggle with deeply nested braces or uncommon syntax.\n\nIf you need a comprehensive list of hyperref commands to remove, extract them from the hyperref package documentation or source code.")
