 "We need concise answer, explain etymology. Provide reasoning. Note: we must not hedge. Provide specific etymology. Use technical terminology. Possibly from Greek 'apo' and 'plēctō' via Latin 'apoplexus'? Apoplectic meaning furious or having apoplexy (stroke). Derive from Latin 'apoplexus' from Greek 'apoplexion', from 'apo-' + 'plēctō' means to strike down. Provide details."
 "**Apoplectic** derives from the Latin *apoplexus*, past participle of *apoplexō* “to strike down, overwhelm.”  \n*Apoplexō* comes from the Greek *apoplexion* (ἀποπληξίών), itself a compound of *apo-* “from, away” + *plēctō* “to strike, to beat.” Originally the word described an apoplexy — a medical collapse or stroke – and by extension, extreme anger or frenzy created by being struck down. The English adjective entered usage in the early 17th century to mean “overcome with rage.”")
