Since they haven't asked any specific question or requested any information yet, I'll just acknowledge their greeting and express that I'm here to help if needed.\n\nI'll respond with:\n\"Hello! How can I assist you today?\"\n\nThis response is friendly, professional, and opens the door for them to let me know what they need help with."
